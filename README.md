# Othello
A simple Othello (Reversi) game made in Java.

 The user can play against an AI. The AI uses a simple Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning with a depth of 7 half moves. It uses several heuristics suitable for a game of Othello. The simple UI is made in Java Swing.
 
 You need a Java 8 compiler to run it. Just compile Game.java and run it with the following command:

> javac Game.java && java Game
